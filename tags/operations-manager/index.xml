            <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel is truly a rare kind of a person. He always wants to help and he does it with a smile.
I think what made me love Daniel was his passion for bug solving. He has an amazing mind that somehow manages to quickly find the most efficient solution for the most complex problem - I admit I&amp;rsquo;m sometimes jealous of this skill. Daniel is a bonus to any team, as he manages to master any skill you throw at him&lt;/p&gt;
