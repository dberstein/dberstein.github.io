He is quick, methodical,
and well thought-out but his knowledge extends beyond that of a traditional developer into one who
understands business processes and the interconnection between. He would be a tremendous asset to any
organization. It&amp;rsquo;s been a pleasure having him as a client and as a partner in achieving our client goals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Recommendation :: David Taber</title><link>/Users/daniel/Code/hugo-daniel.berste.in/public/recommendation/2008/david-taber/index.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2016 08:22:22 +0200</pubDate><author>Daniel Berstein (daniel@basegeo.com)</author><guid>/Users/daniel/Code/hugo-daniel.berste.in/public/recommendation/2008/david-taber/</guid><description>&lt;p>Daniel is one of the most creative and versatile developers I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked with. He&amp;rsquo;s quite good at
understanding business objectives and coming up with three different &amp;ndash; but equally viable &amp;ndash; ways to solve
the issues. Although he&amp;rsquo;s an engineer&amp;rsquo;s engineer, he knows how to understand business issues and he&amp;rsquo;s quite
good at anticipating problems and architecting solutions. Wish I could work with him again, or others equally
good. A rare bird!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
