while completing his tasks. Daniel is a VERY social person and is loved by all his colleagues. We used to
work together planning the new software update mechanism of Zend Network, Daniel &amp;ldquo;jumped into the
water&amp;rdquo; showing huge knowledge of how complex web based server should work, always with a smile and
good advice. I wish to work with Daniel again someday.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
