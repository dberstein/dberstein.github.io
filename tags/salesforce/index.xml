            <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel is one of the brightest developer&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure to work with. He is quick, methodical,
and well thought-out but his knowledge extends beyond that of a traditional developer into one who
understands business processes and the interconnection between. He would be a tremendous asset to any
organization. It&amp;rsquo;s been a pleasure having him as a client and as a partner in achieving our client goals.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel is one of the most creative and versatile developers I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked with. He&amp;rsquo;s quite good at
understanding business objectives and coming up with three different &amp;ndash; but equally viable &amp;ndash; ways to solve
the issues. Although he&amp;rsquo;s an engineer&amp;rsquo;s engineer, he knows how to understand business issues and he&amp;rsquo;s quite
good at anticipating problems and architecting solutions. Wish I could work with him again, or others equally
good. A rare bird!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;My first contact with Daniel began several years ago when he expressed interest in the Zend PHP
Certification Program. He went on to become one of the first PHP Certified Engineers from Israel in Zendâ€™s
online listing of Zend Certified Engineers. Later he joined the Zend team and has proven to be not only
a brilliant developer but also a team player with the gift of resolving issues in a responsive and efficient
manner.&lt;/p&gt;
