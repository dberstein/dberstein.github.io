            <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel is a very detailed and conscientious engineer. He brought some tremendous contributions to Zend and
was an excellent troubleshooter and solver of issues. I would highly recommend him in any team looking for
the above strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;My first contact with Daniel began several years ago when he expressed interest in the Zend PHP
Certification Program. He went on to become one of the first PHP Certified Engineers from Israel in Zendâ€™s
online listing of Zend Certified Engineers. Later he joined the Zend team and has proven to be not only
a brilliant developer but also a team player with the gift of resolving issues in a responsive and efficient
manner.&lt;/p&gt;
