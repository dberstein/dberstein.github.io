He is very goal oriented and
an exceptional team player, very devoted to his work and always wants to do everything in a perfect way.
Daniel is one of the best programmers I worked with. There were several situations when under extreme
pressure Daniel suggested brilliant solutions to the problems we had. Daniel is always ready to help other
team members. I really enjoyed working together with Daniel.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
