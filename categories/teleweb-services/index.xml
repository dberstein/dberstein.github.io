Not only is he
a technical wizard, but he also exhibits impressive management and prioritization skills. I enjoyed every
second talking with Daniel about technology, learning new hard core PHP tricks from him and brain storming
together complex availability solutions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
